RandomLetter
============

Gives you a random word from a file of words.

*USAGE*
Archive the xcode project, and export it as a binary.  Run the command (wherever you store it, I copied it to my /usr/local/bin) as such:
RandomLetter <filename>

Where <filename> is a text file of words delimited by the newline character.
